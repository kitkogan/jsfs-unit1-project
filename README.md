# JSFS Unit1: Random Quote Generator
 Unit 1 Project: Random Quote Genorator

For this first project, I built a random quote generator, which displays quotations on a page, and can be controlled by the user. I recieved an 'Exceed Expectations' grade for this project.

Instructions for this project:
Create an array of objects to store the data for quotes

Add data to quote objects

Create the getRandomQuote function
 
Create the getRandomColor function

Create the printQuote function


Extra Credit:
Add more properties to the quote object
For example, a tags property could include a list of "tags" like "humor", "business", or "politics" to categorize each quote.
Use the new properties to conditionally add to the HTML string that gets printed to the screen.

When the quote changes, randomly change the background color of the page.

After a set amount of time, print a new quote to the page.
